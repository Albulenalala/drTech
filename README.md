This project is a simple web application for managing hospital appointments using PHP, HTML, and CSS. It facilitates online appointment requests for patients and helps doctors manage their schedules. The system includes three roles: administrator, doctor, and patient.

Administrator: Manages the system, adds doctors with their specialties, details, and credentials.
Doctor: Views their appointments and patient requests.
Patient: Searches for doctors by specialty, reviews doctors' schedules, and submits appointment requests.
Patients can find and book appointments with suitable doctors, while doctors can efficiently manage their appointment schedules.
